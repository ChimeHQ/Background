## Contributing and Collaboration

I'd love to hear from you! Get in touch via an issue or pull request.

I prefer collaboration, and would love to find ways to work together if you have a similar project.

I prefer indentation with tabs for improved accessibility. But, I'd rather you use the system you want and make a PR than hesitate because of whitespace.

By participating in this project you agree to abide by the [Contributor Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
